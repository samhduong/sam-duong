        <h3>Electrical Engineering</h3>
        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Sam and I'm currently a fourth-year B.S. Electrical Engineering candidate at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. 
            I have a passion for power and energy, especially areas focusing on renewability and sustainability. 
            As a student, I gain more interest in electronics as time goes on through the different curriculum I experience, such as work with microcontrollers (PIC18F4321, Arduino Uno, etc.), 
            control systems, and of course, power. 
            I have been familiar with the engineering field ever since I was a child; my high school curriculum was specialized in both engineering and biomedical sciences and
            I graduated completing the Engineering track. During my time there, I committed 4 years to my community FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) robotics team, Team 4999 Momentum Robotics.
            There, I got my first exposure to FPGA's, servomotors, pulse-width-modulation, and communications, some of the core aspects of building a functional robot. It was then and
            there that I knew I wanted to pursue the study of electronics and its applications in the world. <br><br>
            Currently, I am a part of BANSHEE UAV, a project club at Cal Poly Pomona. As a member of the Power Management team, our responsibilities include creating and performing testing
            procedures for different methods of passive power generation for a drone the entire BANSHEE team is designing for a coast-to-coast flight. In my downtime between project work,
            this website is actually part of my duties for the project team, as it is a good way to build up skills I might have previously lacked. <br><br>
            I believe my experiences in high school and university have shaped my passions into what it is today and I would love to share that with others. If you have a child with an
            interest in robotics, I've provided resources below to hopefully point you in the right direction.

        <h3>Construction Management</h3>
        <p>While my primary interests lie in electrical engineering, I am also currently considering a career in construction management, from my time with Morrow-Meadows Corporation,
            an electrical contractor. With my (very helpful) supervisor and mentor Bill Nauta, I have experience in many standard construction practices, such as contract review,
            building overlays (Bluebeam Revu), RFI's, change orders, and much more. I gained all of my experience in communication and management through this experience; I would like to
            explore this pathway more and am currently looking for opportunities in both electrical engineering and construction management fields.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Music will always be my first love. I am a lifelong instrumentalist, piano being my main instrument (I also have years of experience with the violin, bass guitar, and double bass).
             I am a member of the Cal Poly Pomona Piano Ensemble, led and advised by the talented Dr. Nadia Shpachenko. As I enter my second year with the group, I find myself rediscovering my
              love for piano performance every rehearsal. I have gotten the wonderful opportunity to work with the composers of the pieces I perform through the ensemble, such as Michael Roth,
              Jonathan Russell, and Tom Flaherty. My next recital with the Cal Poly Pomona Piano Ensemble is November 26th, 2024 at the Cal Poly Pomona Recital Hall. If you are interested in the
              composers I mentioned earlier or my upcoming recital, check out the links below!

        <h3> <a href="https://momentum4999.com/wp/" target="_blank">Momentum Robotics</a></h3>
        <p>Momentum Robotics is the high school community robotics team I was a part of during my time at Eunice Sato Academy of Mathematics and Science, a high school
            specializing in both Engineering and Biomedical Sciences pathways. We participated in the FIRST Robotics Competition every year, where our task was to build a full-scale
            robot designed and built to complete tasks according to the game theme for that year, all within six weeks. This experience was quite formative for me as I got exposure to the
            inner workings of a robot and electronics at large.
        </p><br>
        <h4>2017-2018 Season</h4>
        <p>For the 2017-2018 season, I was a high-school freshman and took on a technician role for the Electrical subunit of the team. I participated in power system design as well as
            make the wired connections for all serial communication in the robot. In addition to my electrical contributions, I also cut out the aluminum stock needed for our intake and climbing
            systems. The theme of the season was called "Power Up!," where teams were tasked to design and develop robots that could
            intake and shoot out themed milk crates onto a scale for points. Momentum Robotics finished in the quarterfinals of the Orange County regionals.

        </iframe><br>
<br><h4>2018-2019 Season</h4>
        <p>In the 2018-2019 season, I took on more responsibility within the electronics subunit of the team, creating the power system design along with my lead at the time, under the mentorship
            of Terry Wells. Again, I wired the entire robot's power system and serial communication buses. Along with the programming lead that season, I interfaced with the FPGA we were using for
            the robot, the NI roboRIO. Although phased out these days (with the roboRIO 2.0), this was the first case of embedded systems I had ever experienced. This was a very digestible and smooth
            introduction to serial communication for me, with the roboRIO having capabilities for I2C and SPI. During this season, the team made a transition from using exclusively PWM devices to using
            both PWM and CAN devices. From this, I gained a lot of experience in serial communication in CAN devices. Momentum Robotics finished the season in the Qualifications phase of the Los Angeles
            regionals.

        </iframe><br>
        <br><h4>2019-2020 Season</h4>
        <p>I took on the role of Electrical Lead for the team in the 2019-2020 season. This leadership opportunity allowed me to empower other students to learn more about electronics and how
            deeply it is ingrained into robotics. With my subunit, I led the team in power system design and build, as well as collaborated with the programming subunit to interface with the roboRIO.
            This season was quite challenging in particular due to the demands of the theme for that year, "Infinite Recharge." There were many moving parts to the game this year. One goal was to shoot 
            foam balls into 2 slots of choice, each at different heights. A second goal was to spin a wheel to the correct configuration for an opportunity at extra points. The final goal of the
            game was to hang onto a bar with a design similar to a coat hanger; a robot grabs one side of the bar and it will start to tip to that robot's side, making it harder for the ally robots
            to grab on to the other side for more points. In terms of electrical design, I was quite challenged by the sheer amount of stretch the robot had to mechanically make, and subsequently, the electrical system.
            As a team, we opted to not consider the wheel task at all in our robot design, as the reward for completing the task was not worth it for the amount of space on the robot it would have to take up.
            Our final decision came to being able to shoot the foam balls at an elevated height, which made the electrical power system plausible and efficient for what little time we had. Momentum robotics
            ended the season in the Qualifications phase in the 2020 Los Angeles Regional. Due to COVID-19, our season was cut short.
        </p><br>
    <h4>2020-2021 Season</h4>
        <p>Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, there was no physical robotics component for the season. However, FIRST created programs for teams to participate in from home. As the captain for Momentum
            Robotics in my fourth and final year, I led my team in FIRST's new competition, FRC Game Design. Our task was to create a theme for a potential game FIRST could host in a future year,
            including rules, visual designs, mechanics, and all other components that could go into an FRC game. My role as a captain blossomed as I engaged in delegation among members working on the
            game. I oversaw all discussion of game mechanics, visual design, and proper documentation. At the end of the season, my team and I presented our proposal to FIRST officials. I'm quite proud
            of my time with Momentum Robotics.
